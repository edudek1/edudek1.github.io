    <p>2018 is going to be a <strong>BIG YEAR</strong>.  We've got spring break, bachelor parties, several friends' weddings, more random travel, and then finally my own wedding coming up in September.  In advance of all this activity, I want to push myself to get in the best shape of my life!</p>
    <p> I've set up this page to share some fitness goals for myself, because as a wise man once said, "If you aren't getting better you're getting worse."</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Before I begin I want to share some inspiration</p>
